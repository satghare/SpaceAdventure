<h1 style="front-size:50px; text-align:center;">A New Adventure In Space</h1>
<p style="front-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;">I was part of a crew that was sent on a mission into outer space.<br>

Rocket Flying Away From Earth
The mission was carried out successfully and I was on my way back to earth with my friends.<br> 

Suddenly, an unidentified flying object appeared and it somehow forced our spacecraft to land on another planet. 

On the planet, a very strange looking creature met us.<br> This creature took my crew and me to see its master.<br> I saw another alien sitting on a very high throne.<br> That must be their master.<br> It wore a crown and looked like all the strange looking creatures in the room but its head was very much bigger.<br> All the aliens had four eyes, two heads and six legs.<br> They had a white body and no hair.<br> 

A Blue Planet The strange unknown planet looked like a prison, no worst … a dungeon.<br> There was a very high wall all around the planet.<br> It had many buildings and everywhere you went, you could hear the wailing sounds coming from small cells.<br> 

We were scared but they gave us some food, which smelt like rotten fish.<br> The smell was so strong that we had to hold our breath in order not to faint.<br> No one dared to touch the food.<br> 

The next day, we were given a long list of things to do but they were in a language that we could not understand at all.<br> They whipped us and put us in a small cell.<br> After that, they conducted experiments on us. A few of us died but the rest of us who survived were put back into the cell. 

One day, the aliens who brought us to our cell forgot to lock the door so we escaped through the door.<br> Soon we boarded our own spaceship and flew back to earth.<br> We had a horrifying experience but no one believed us! After this, I never dared to go into space ever again.</p>
